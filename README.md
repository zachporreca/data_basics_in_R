# Data Basics in R at CFE Empirical Workshop 


Hey guys, it was fun getting to trying to show you around some of the basic R stuff with an applied approach. 

The data file I was using are all here in this repository.

To replicate what we went over today you will need to do the following:
   1) Download the main data files and code from this repository and set the folder you put those in as your working directory
   2) Download the incident level data file from the google drive link: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/177uWCFInciQCbtTMkwNldHhgGNhN1XPS/view?usp=sharing)
   3) Install the following packages for R:
        1) haven
        2) fixest
   4) The code is commented out so you are able to see what each section is intended to do/ what question it is answering

Packages for R can be installed as follows:

    1)  In RStudio's top menu choose "Tools"
    2)  Select "Install Packages" from the drop down menu
    3)  Enter the names of the packages you'd like to install (seperating each by a comma)
    4)  Ensure that the "Install dependencies" box is checked
    5)  Click install
    
Play around a bit, and try replicating some of the code on your own data!

As a note, the panel data used here is from Abrams (2012) paper on criminal deterrance and the incident-level microdata utilized is taken from Philadelphia's Open Data portal. It is the incident-level crime data for the year 2019.
